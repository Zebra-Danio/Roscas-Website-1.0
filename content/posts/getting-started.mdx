# Getting Started with Roscas

Welcome to our guide on getting started with Roscas! If you're new to the concept of Rotating Savings and Credit Associations, this post will help you understand how they work and how to participate.

## What is a Rosca?

A Rosca (Rotating Savings and Credit Association) is a group of individuals who come together to save and borrow money. Each member contributes a fixed amount to a common fund, which is then given to one member in each cycle.

## Benefits of Joining a Rosca

- **Forced Savings**: Regular contributions help you build savings discipline
- **Access to Funds**: Get access to a lump sum without formal banking
- **Community Support**: Financial goals are achieved together with community backing
- **No Interest**: Unlike traditional loans, there's typically no interest charged

## How to Join

1. Create an account on our platform
2. Browse available Roscas or create your own
3. Set your contribution amount and frequency
4. Invite friends or join an existing community

## Example of a Rosca Cycle

Let's say 10 members each contribute $100 monthly:

```
Month 1: Member A receives $1,000
Month 2: Member B receives $1,000
...
Month 10: Member J receives $1,000
```

Each member contributes $1,000 total and receives $1,000 once.
